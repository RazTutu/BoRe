      <p class="nature-text">
        In Japan, cherry blossoms symbolize clouds due to their nature of
        blooming en masse, besides being an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral
        nature of life an aspect of Japanese cultural tradition that is often
        associated with Buddhist influence and which is embodied in the concept
        of mono no aware.The association of the cherry blossom with mono no
        aware dates back to 18th-century scholar Motoori Norinaga.

        Every year the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the public track the
        sakura zensen (cherry blossom front) as it moves northward up the
        archipelago with the approach of warmer weather via nightly forecasts
        following the weather segment of news programs. The blossoming begins in
        Okinawa in January, and typically reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the end of
        March or the beginning of April. It proceeds into areas at the higher
        altitudes and northward, arriving in Hokkaido a few weeks later.
