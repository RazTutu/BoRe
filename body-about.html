        Here you can see reviews of the latest added books, so you can get some
        quick opinions and see if what you're looking for is worth reading, why
        should you read that book and ultimately if it's worth buying. There are
        plenty of genres available, or you can start a new one. If you didn't
        finish the book you can save the progress you made each day to know
        where you are. Finished it? Why not add a review :)

        How did BookReviewer start?
      </h2>
      <p class="nature-text">
        Everything started on March 2020 when a team of 3 people studying
        computer science at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University was assigned with
        this project during the Web Technologies class. It was an entire
        semester long project and they had to add new things as they learned
        more. The main purpose was to learn better how to work in a team, and to
        get used with PHP, MySql, HTML, CSS, Javascript and more.
